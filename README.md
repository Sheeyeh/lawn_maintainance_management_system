# Lawn Maintenance Management System

Lawn Maintenance Management System is a backend-powered service platform that automates and manages smart lawn care through intelligent scheduling, worker dispatching, and IoT-based fertilizer monitoring.

# ðŸŒ± Key Features
### Smart Fertilizer Monitoring
Each subscribed user receives a specialized sprinkler device pre-loaded with our custom fertilizer. This device includes a built-in sensor that monitors the fertilizer concentration. When the concentration drops below a safe threshold, the sensor sends an alert signal to our backend server.

#### Automated Refill Orders
Upon receiving a low-fertilizer alert, the system automatically creates a refill order â€” no user action required. This order is then available for workers to claim and fulfill by refilling the sprinkler with fertilizer.
### Two-Sided Platform (User & Worker)
* 	User Side: Users can place lawn care service orders, view their order history, and rate workers after job completion.  

*	Worker Side: Workers can view, accept, and complete available orders. The system assigns tasks based on time and location for optimal efficiency.
### Intelligent Task Assignment
Orders are automatically assigned based on user-submitted time and address, ensuring timely and localized service â€” similar to how ride-sharing platforms like Uber manage job distribution.
